Month 1 - Week 1 - Day 3

Today I:
- Practiced shell redirection using >, >>, and 2> to separate stdout and stderr.
- Learned to combine stdout and stderr into a single log file using 2>&1.
- Created a sample application log file (app.log).
- Used grep, wc, sort, uniq, and tail to search and summarize log data.
- Practiced tail -f to simulate real-time log monitoring.
