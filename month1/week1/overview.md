# Month 1 - Week 1 Overview

This week I practiced Linux and Git fundamentals, including:

- Shell navigation: using `pwd`, `ls`, and `cd` to move around the filesystem.
- File and directory operations: creating, copying, moving, and deleting files and folders safely in an isolated lab structure.
- Permissions: changing file permissions with `chmod` (600, 644, 755) and understanding owner/group/other access.
- Shell scripts: writing and executing simple Bash scripts to automate small tasks.
- File inspection: viewing content with `cat`, `head`, `tail`, and `less`.
- Redirection and pipes: using `>`, `>>`, `2>`, `2>&1`, and `|` to redirect output and chain commands.
- Log-style analysis: practicing `grep`, `wc`, `sort`, `uniq`, and `tail -f` on a sample application log file.

All hands-on work is organized under `month1/week1/day1`, `day2`, and `day3` in this repository.
