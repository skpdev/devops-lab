Today I:
- Reviewed Git status, log, and diff to understand repository history and changes.
- Created a dedicated feature branch (feature-week1-overview) from main.
- Added a high-level Week 1 overview document describing my Linux and Git practice.
- Pushed the feature branch to GitHub and merged it back into main.
- (Optional) Deleted the feature branch locally and remotely for a clean branch list.
